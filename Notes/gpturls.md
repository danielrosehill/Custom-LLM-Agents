## Notes On GPT URLs

At the time of writing, OpenAI does not commit to saving users' custom GPTs indefinitely. The current process is that the GPTs may be deactivated if the user changes paying tier. As I don't and can't commit to maintaining a paid subscription indefinitely, it's possible that the URLs will not resolve. The URLs for private GPTs are not shared.
