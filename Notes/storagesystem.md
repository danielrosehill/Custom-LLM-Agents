## Storing Custom GPTs

In day-to-day use, I'm using a system I'm building on top of NocoDB for storing custom GPTs, a prompt library, and a record of GPT outputs.

If you're interested, I'm open-sourcing that project [here](https://github.com/danielrosehill/GPT-Management-System).

This repository operates on a bit of a lag but includes many of the custom GPTs that I use day-to-day.
