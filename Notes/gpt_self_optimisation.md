## GPT Self-Optimisation: Snippets

 The ability to use GPT to self-correct its own configuration opens up quite incredible possibilities.

 I've bucketed a few snippets into a prompt snippets folder, but these ones are good enough for most use-cases:

 ### To optimise custom GPT configuration texts, consider running:

 ```
 Please optimise the following configuration script which is intended to create a custom GPT on the ChatGPT platform. 

Please return the optimised version of the configuration text. 
```

### To optimise individual prompts, consider running:

```
Please optimise this prompt so that it produces the most useful output:

[prompt]
```
