# Daniel Rosehill Custom ChatGPT GPTs

This repository contains links to custom GPTs that I have build on top of ChatGPT.

I create this (typically) for specific use-cases. The overarching objective is to create a sort of "fleet" of GPT agents to help me manage various aspects of my work and personal lives.

 ## Key Parts Of this Repo
 
 I've tinkered with various ways of saving and sharing my custom GPT configurations with the intention of open-sourcing them to help others replicate them.

 While outputting them from my databasing software is perhaps the most technically elegant system (I store the configurations in a NoCoDB instance), ultimately, I have concluded that sharing the configurations as individual markdown files is probably more useful for readers.

 As a "quick and dirty" organisation system, I've bucketed those under a folder which is currently called "individual GPT configs" (or a similar filename). I am organising them into folders there.

 The database exports / CSVs are likely to be out of date.

 ## Quick Snippets

 The ability to use GPT to self-correct its own configuration opens up quite incredible possibilities.

 I've bucketed a few snippets into a prompt snippets folder, but these ones are good enough for most use-cases:

 ## To optimise custom GPT configuration texts, consider running:

 ```
 Please optimise the following configuration script which is intended to create a custom GPT on the ChatGPT platform. 

Please return the optimised version of the configuration text. 
```

## To optimise individual prompts, consider running:

```
Please optimise this prompt so that it produces the most useful output:

[prompt]
```
