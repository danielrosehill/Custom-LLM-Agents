# Daniel Rosehill Open Source Custom GPT Library

## About This Repository

This repository contains links to custom GPTs that I have build on top of ChatGPT (*although increasingly I'm exploring the use of other GPTs including Claude*).

I am finding amazing utility in creating custom GPTs for specific purposes (commonly those related to my professional life). 

However, while it lacks the ability of custom GPTs to quickly store detailed contextual information, prompt engineering is often enough to quickly and dramatically accelerate the value yielded from working with GPTs.

The overarching objective is to create a sort of "fleet" of GPT agents to help me manage various aspects of my work and personal lives.

Like everything I open-source, I'm doing so to make a small contribution to the collective sum of human knowledge. If you'd like to use any of these GPTs for whatever reason, you have my full permission to do so.

 ## Key Parts Of this Repo
 
 I've tinkered with various ways of saving and sharing my custom GPT configurations with the intention of open-sourcing them to help others replicate them. This is in addition to my own internal system for logging custom GPTs I have created to enable their easy retrieval and to serve as a backup of their configurations (for this purpose, I am using NocoDB).

 While outputting them from my databasing software is perhaps the most technically elegant system for open-sourcing configurations, ultimately, I have concluded that sharing the configurations as individual markdown files is probably more useful for those who may wish to use them for their own purposes.

 As a "quick and dirty" organisation system, I've bucketed those under a folder which is currently called "individual GPT configs" (or a similar filename). I am organising them into folders there.

 The database exports / CSVs are likely to be out of date.

 ## Quick Snippets

 The ability to use GPT to self-correct its own configuration opens up quite incredible possibilities.

 I've bucketed a few snippets into a prompt snippets folder, but these ones are good enough for most use-cases:

 ## To optimise custom GPT configuration texts, consider running:

 ```
 Please optimise the following configuration script which is intended to create a custom GPT on the ChatGPT platform. 

Please return the optimised version of the configuration text. 
```

## To optimise individual prompts, consider running:

```
Please optimise this prompt so that it produces the most useful output:

[prompt]
```

## Notes On GPT URLs

At the time of writing, OpenAI does not commit to saving users' custom GPTs indefinitely. The current process is that the GPTs may be deactivated if the user changes paying tier. As I don't and can't commit to maintaining a paid subscription indefinitely, it's possible that the URLs will not resolve. The URLs for private GPTs are not shared.

## A Note About Gender Pronouns

To achieve effective outputs with GPTs, concise prompts and configuration texts are advised. In the interest of streamlining generation, I use 'he' as a pronoun to refer to the user. This is simply for pragmatic reasons and should not adversely affect the usability of the GPT for users who identify in other terms.
