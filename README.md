# Daniel Rosehill Custom ChatGPT GPTs

This repository contains links to custom GPTs that I have build on top of ChatGPT.

I create this (typically) for specific use-cases. I often use them together. The overarching objective is to create a sort of "fleet" of GPT agents to help me manage various aspects of my work and personal lives.

The custom GPTs are organised into timestamped folders with the format `ddmmyy`

Within each folder, I have separated the custom GPTs according to their purpoase.

Please feel free to make use of any of the custom GPTs for your own requirements.
