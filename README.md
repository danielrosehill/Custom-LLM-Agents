# Daniel Rosehill Open Source Custom GPT Library

## View The GPTs

For the custom GPTs, see the `GPTs` folder in the repo.

It's [here](https://github.com/danielrosehill/My-Custom-GPTs/tree/main/GPTs).

## GPT List

## About This Repository

This repository contains links to custom GPTs that I have build on top of ChatGPT (*although increasingly I'm exploring the use of other GPTs including Claude*).

I am finding amazing utility in creating custom GPTs for specific purposes (commonly those related to my professional life). 

However, while it lacks the ability of custom GPTs to quickly store detailed contextual information, prompt engineering is often enough to quickly and dramatically accelerate the value yielded from working with GPTs.

The overarching objective is to create a sort of "fleet" of GPT agents to help me manage various aspects of my work and personal lives.

Like everything I open-source, I'm doing so to make a small contribution to the collective sum of human knowledge. If you'd like to use any of these GPTs for whatever reason, you have my full permission to do so.

## File Formats

GPTs are organised into folders describing their purpose.

- GPTName/
  - Config/
    - config.txt
    - config.json
  - about.md
  
In this setup:

- `config.txt` is a text file containing the GPT configuration
- `config.json` is a JSON file containing the GPT configuration
- `about.md` is a markdown document describing the purpose of the GPT and providing other details intended for a human reader

You can use `JSON` directly in ChatGPT's custom GPT editor to effectively recreate any of these GPTs.


## Other Notes

See the `Notes` folder for other small details.
