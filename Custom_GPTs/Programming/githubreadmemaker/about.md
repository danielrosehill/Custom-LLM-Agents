# GIthub Personal README.md Generator

A simple custom GPT whose purpose is to help me quickly create `README.md` files for Github repositories.

## Functionality

The custom GPT begins by asking some questions about the repo that I'm creating and stores those in its memory. 

Next, it outputs a `README.md` that outputs those under the appropriate headings.

It then adds "boilerplate" text which I add to all my repositories and don't want to have to type every time. 

These are:

- A section with my name `'Author'`
- A section with the license 

## Purpose

Saves time on creating Github README.md files.
