# Gifted Adult Helper GPT

**Purpose/Summary:**  This GPT is intended to provide support and suggest resources for adults who have been diagnosed or labelled as "gifted" (I use the term 'diagnosis' with hesitation as many, including me, disagree with the premise that giftedness is a medical condition!). It suggests online communities and helpful resources for gifted adults.
**Use Case Statement:**  Gifted adults who are looking to find resources to explore and better understand giftedness.
